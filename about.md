Hi! I'm Patrick, a junior in [CS](cs.uw.edu) and [ecomonics](econ.uw.edu)
at the [University of Washington](uw.edu). This site functions both as my personal site
and as a collection of blog posts about projects/research I've worked on. 

My big interests are in machine learning and game theory. I work in the MODE Lab at UW
on neuro-science focused state space models. 

Both my Github and email address can be found in the footer below.
