        <h1>Project Malibu</h1> 
        <p> I've be interested in building a quadcopter for a while, mostly as an exercise in learning basic electronics and aerodynamics. This page will hopefully chronicle the drone's construction and deployment.</p> 
        <p> There are a few basic goals for the project:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Basic flight within eye sight with pre-built controller</li>
            <li>FPV video streaming from the drone to MacBook</li>
            <li>SDR radio control of the drone from MacBook with arbitrary controller (I'm thinking wheel)</li>
            <li>Autonomous flight of some kind</li>
            <li>Real-time video analysis and feedback (object recognition)</li>
        </ul>
